# Sound the Alarm!
# A Survey of Modern Intrusion Detection Methodologies

A place to put our thoughts about the presentation

Awesomeness
-------------
* Theme: light background, dark text
* Color scheme: tech light
* Cats: Yes, lots, everyone on the internet loves cats

Differences between this and paper
-----------------------------------
* Presentation should have a TLDR slide at the end of every section
* Sections we need that aren''t necesarily in paper
    * The story of our klugefest        -- Jake can do this
    * What we learned
    * Future work??
    * Can tell the UPS story with SNORT
