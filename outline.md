Abstract

Introduction
==============
1.  Why are these systems important

2.  Why are we writing this paper
    * Aggregate knowledge on the subject as a whole bc for the most part it is
        distributed
    * Write to a less knowledgeable audience, treating this as an introduction to
        the field of study

3. Lay out the structure of the paper, including each type of attack
    

Body
=======
Intrusion Detection Systems
-----------------------------
1.  Audit Systems
    * Host based
    * Network based
    * Application Based

2.  Event Analysis
    * Signature based
    * Anomaly based

Breakdown of Attacks and Detection
------------------------------------
1.  Probes
    * Port Scans

2.  Privilege Escalation
    
3.  Denial of Service
    * Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) 

4. Remote to Local 

Conclusion
------------
    What the hell have we learned??
    Cats!
    
    * Most probing activity can be detected using signature based methods
        * BUT WHAT SHOULD ONE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION?
        
    * A multi-tiered system is the most effective
        * Network based sensors configured for detecting probing activity
        * host based sensors for privilege escalation attacks
        * Needs to be used in conjunction with a file wall/defence system
