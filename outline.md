1.  Why are these systems important

2.  Why are we writing this paper
    * Aggregate knowledge on the subject as a whole bc for the most part it is
        distributed
    * Write to a less knowledgeable audience, treating this as an introduction to
        the field of study

3. Lay out the structure of the paper, including each type of attack
