\section{Related Work}
    % I think we want to model this section after [Bhuyan, Bhattacharyya, Kalitan]
    % Their paper is in the probes section of Mendeley,you should go check it out
    \subsection{Probes}
    \subsection{Privilege Escalation}
    \paragraph{Privilege Escalation attacks are described in two general categories in this paper: Remote to User Attacks and User to Root Attacks. In the broadest sense, Remote to User Attacks are when an attacker seeks to gain local user access to a machine that they have network access to. A User to Root Attack, as one may infer from its name, is when an attacker who already possesses local user access seeks to escalate their privileges to those of a root user, IE gain root user access. In the following sections, both types of attacks are explained in detail.}

    \paragraph{User to root attacks}
    \subsection{Denial of Service}

\section{Methods}
    % This is where we should talk about why we broke attacks up the way that we 
    % did.

\section{Evaluation}
    % I am not so sure we even need this section, if we use it we could talk 
    % about the limitations of IDS's of something, the current state of affairs

\section{Discussion}
    % What would we say here?
    % J: Perhaps we could talk about need for attack categorization stuff here.

\section{Conclusions}
    % See outline for this bit

\section{References}
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{Proposal}{}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
\nocite{*}
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
